Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

### Freeverb - Free, studio-quality reverb SOURCE CODE in the public domain ###
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Written by Jezar at Dreampoint - http://www.dreampoint.co.uk


Introduction
------------

Hello.

I'll try to keep this "readme" reasonably small. There are few things in the world that I hate more than long "readme" files. Except "coding conventions" - but more on that later...

In this zip file you will find two folders of C++ source code:

"Components" - Contains files that should clean-compile ON ANY TYPE OF COMPUTER OR SYSTEM WHATSOEVER. It should not be necessary to make ANY changes to these files to get them to compile, except to make up for inadequacies of certain compilers. These files create three classes - a comb filter, an allpass filter, and a reverb model made up of a number of instances of the filters, with some features to control the filters at a macro level. You will need to link these classes into another program that interfaces with them. The files in the components drawer are completely independant, and can be built without dependancies on anything else. Because of the simple interface, it should be possible to interface these files to any system - VST, DirectX, anything - without changing them AT ALL.

"FreeverbVST" - Contains a Steinberg VST implementation of this version of Freeverb, using the components in (surprise) the components folder. It was built on a PC but may compile properly for the Macintosh with no problems. I don't know - I don't have a Macintosh. If you've figured out how to compile the examples in the Steinberg VST Development Kit, then you should easilly figure out how to bring the files into a project and get it working in a few minutes. It should be very simple.

Note that this version of Freeverb doesn't contain predelay, or any EQ. I thought that might make it difficult to understand the "reverb" part of the code. Once you figure out how Freeverb works, you should find it trivial to add such features with little CPU overhead.

Also, the code in this version of Freeverb has been optimised. This has changed the sound *slightly*, but not significantly compared to how much processing power it saves.

Finally, note that there is also a built copy of this version of Freeverb called "Freeverb3.dll" - this is a VST plugin for the PC. If you want a version for the Mac or anything else, then you'll need to build it yourself from the code.


Technical Explanation
---------------------

Freeverb is a simple implementation of the standard Schroeder/Moorer reverb model. I guess the only reason why it sounds better than other reverbs, is simply because I spent a long while doing listening tests in order to create the values found in "tuning.h". It uses 8 comb filters on both the left and right channels), and you might possibly be able to get away with less if CPU power is a serious constraint for you. It then feeds the result of the reverb through 4 allpass filters on both the left and right channels. These "smooth" the sound. Adding more than four allpasses doesn't seem to add anything significant to the sound, and if you use less, the sound gets a bit "grainy". The filters on the right channel are slightly detuned compared to the left channel in order to create a stereo effect.

Hopefully, you should find the code in the components drawer a model of brevity and clarity. Notice that I don't use any "coding conventions". Personally, I think that coding conventions suck. They are meant to make the code "clearer", but they inevitably do the complete opposite, making the code completely unfathomable. Anyone whose done Windows programming with its - frankly stupid - "Hungarian notation" will know exactly what I mean. Coding conventions typically promote issues that are irrelevant up to the status of appearing supremely important. It may have helped back people in the days when compilers where somewhat feeble in their type-safety, but not in the new millenium with advanced C++ compilers.

Imagine if we rewrote the English language to conform to coding conventions. After all, The arguments should be just as valid for the English language as they are for a computer language. For example, we could put a lower-case "n" in front of every noun, a lower-case "p" in front of a persons name, a lower-case "v" in front of every verb, and a lower-case "a" in front of every adjective. Can you imagine what the English language would look like? All in the name of "clarity". It's just as stupid to do this for computer code as it would be to do it for the English language. I hope that the code for Freeverb in the components drawer demonstrates this, and helps start a movement back towards sanity in coding practices.


Background
----------

Why is the Freeverb code now public domain? Simple. I only intended to create Freeverb to provide me and my friends with studio-quality reverb for free. I never intended to make any money out of it. However, I simply do not have the time to develop it any further. I'm working on a "concept album" at the moment, and I'll never finish it if I spend any more time programming. 

In any case, I make more far money as a contract programmer - making Mobile Internet products - than I ever could writing plugins, so it simply doesn't make financial sense for me to spend any more time on it.

Rather than give Freeverb to any particular individual or organisation to profit from it, I've decided to give it away to the internet community at large, so that quality, FREE (or at the very least, low-cost) reverbs can be developed for all platforms.

Feel free to use the source code for Freeverb in any of your own products, whether they are also available for free, or even if they are commercial - I really don't mind. You may do with the code whatever you wish. If you use it in a product (whether commercial or not), it would be very nice of you, if you were to send me a copy of your product - although I appreciate that this isn't always possible in all circumstances.

HOWEVER, please don't bug me with questions about how to use this code. I gave away Freeverb because I don't have time to maintain it. That means I *certainly* don't have time to answer questions about the source code, so please don't email questions to me. I *will* ignore them. If you can't figure the code for Freeverb out - then find somebody who can. I hope that either way, you enjoy experimenting with it.


Disclaimer
----------

This software and source code is given away for free, without any warranties of any kind. It has been given away to the internet community as a free gift, so please treat it in the same spirit.


I hope this code is useful and interesting to you all!
I hope you have lots of fun experimenting with it and make good products!

Very best regards,
Jezar.
