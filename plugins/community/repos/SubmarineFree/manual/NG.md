## Basic Operation

The NG-112 provides 12 gates. It is designed to take digital signals, but it will happily accept analog signals. 

## Signal Range

The voltage range of the digital gates can be configured from the context menu. The device will output at the full range of the configured settings. The inputs will measure a logical high signal anywhere above the midpoint of the configured range.

## Normalling

Any input not connected will cause a high signal at the corresponding output. The NG-112 can be used with inputs disconnected to provide stable 1V, 5V or 10V signals.

By connected a single output to the input of another gate, it is possible to generate stable 0V, -5V and -10V signals.
